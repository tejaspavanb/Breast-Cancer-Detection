# Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect malignant and benign breast cancer images from the Breast Histopathology Images dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used is [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) from Kaggle. 
Please download the dataset using Kaggle API or manually from the link.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-detection.git
cd breast-cancer-detection
