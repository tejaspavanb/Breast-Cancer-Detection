# Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect malignant and benign breast cancer images from the Breast Histopathology Images dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used is [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) from Kaggle. 
Please download the dataset using Kaggle API or manually from the link.

Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in histopathology images.
Preprocessed medical images from the Kaggle IDC dataset using OpenCV, resizing and normalizing images for optimal training performance.

Implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras with multiple convolutional layers, achieving accurate classification of malignant and benign tissue samples.
Used Kaggle API to download datasets programmatically and employed train-test-validation splits for model training and evaluation.
Achieved 90% accuracy in detecting breast cancer using CNN after model training.

Deployed the model for predictions on new histopathology images and saved the trained model in the new Keras format (.keras).
Documented and shared the project on GitHub for reproducibility.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Kaggle API, Jupyter Notebook
